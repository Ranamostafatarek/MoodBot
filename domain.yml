  utter_depression:
  - text: "Depression is classified as a mood disorder. It may be described as feelings of sadness, loss, or anger that interfere with a person’s everyday activities. Though depression and grief share some features, depression is different from grief felt after losing a loved one or sadness felt after a traumatic life event. Depression usually involves self-loathing or a loss of self-esteem, while grief typically does not."

  utter_anxiety:
  - text: "Anxiety is your body’s natural response to stress. It’s a feeling of fear or apprehension about what’s to come. The first day of school, going to a job interview, or giving a speech may cause most people to feel fearful and nervous. But if your feelings of anxiety are extreme, last for longer than six months, and are interfering with your life, you may have an anxiety disorder."

  utter_OCD:
  - text: "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic mental health condition that involves obsessions, compulsions, or both. People living with OCD typically experience obsessions, or repetitive unwanted thoughts that prompt an extreme urge to repeat a specific behavior. They then act out that urge, or compulsion, to help relieve the obsessive thought. Plenty of people double-check to make sure they’ve locked the front door or turned off the stove. These habits might help you feel more secure, but they don’t automatically suggest OCD."

  utter_PTSD:
  - text: "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disorder that begins after a traumatic event. That event may involve a real or perceived threat of injury or death. This can include:

a natural disaster like an earthquake or tornado, military combat physical or sexual violence, physical or sexual abuse or an accident.
People with PTSD often feel a heightened sense of danger. Their natural fight-or-flight response is altered, causing them to feel stressed or fearful, even when they’re in a safe situation."

  utter_ADHD:
  - text: "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental health condition that can cause unusual levels of hyperactivity and impulsive behaviors. People with ADHD may also have trouble focusing their attention on a single task or sitting still for long periods of time. Many people experience inattention and changes in energy levels. For a person with ADHD, this happens more often and to a greater extent compared with people who don’t have the condition. It can have a significant effect on their studies, work, and home life."

  utter_depression_symptoms:
  - text: "If you experience some of the following signs and symptoms of depression nearly every day for at least 2 weeks, you may be living with depression: feeling sad or “empty”, feeling hopeless, worthless or pessimistic, crying a lot, feeling bothered, annoyed, or angry, loss of interest in hobbies and interests you once enjoyed, decreased energy or fatigue, difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions, moving or talking more slowly, difficulty sleeping, early morning awakening, or oversleeping, appetite or weight changes, chronic physical pain with no clear cause that does not get better with treatment (headaches, aches or pains, digestive problems, cramps), thoughts of death, suicide, self-harm, or suicide attempts.

Examples of compulsive behaviors in OCD include: washing your hands, objects, or body, organizing or aligning objects in a specific way, counting or repeating specific phrases, touching something a set number of times, seeking reassurance from others, collecting certain objects or buying several of the same item, hiding objects you could use to hurt yourself or someone else, mentally going over your actions to make sure you haven’t harmed anyone else."

  utter_PTSD_symptoms:
  - text: "Symptoms of PTSD fall into four groups: 1. Intrusion like: flashbacks where you feel like you relive the event over and over, vivid, unpleasant memories of the event infiltrating seemingly unrelated thoughts or memories, frequent nightmares about the event, intense mental or physical distress when you think about the event. 2. Avoidance like: avoiding people, places, or situations that remind you of the traumatic event. 3. Arousal and reactivity like: trouble concentrating, startling easily and having an exaggerated response when you’re startled, a constant feeling of being on edge, irritability, bouts of anger. 4. Cognition and mood like: negative thoughts about yourself, distorted feelings of guilt, worry, or blame, trouble remembering important parts of the event, reduced interest in activities you once loved."
